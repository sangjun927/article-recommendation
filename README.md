# Article Recommendation

This project was part of the Data Acquisition (MSDS 692) course at the University of San Francisco. The goal of the project is to learn how to make a simple article recommendation engine using word vectors (word2vec). In particular, we're going to use a "database" of word vectors from Stanford's GloVe project trained on a dump of Wikipedia. The project involves reading in a database of word vectors and a corpus of text articles then organizing them into a handy table (list of lists) for processing.
