# Article Recommendation

This project, part of the Data Acquisition course (MSDS 692) at the University of San Francisco, creates a simple article recommendation engine. It uses word vectors from the GloVe project, trained on Wikipedia, to analyze and recommend similar articles. The process involves loading word vectors and a collection of text articles into a structured format for analysis. The aim is to learn how to build a recommendation system using these word embeddings.
